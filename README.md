# Embeddings training using Law Texts

## Steps

- Structure texts into dataset
    - TJ-SC
    - STJ 
    - STF

- Create another dataset with additional documents such as Vade Mecum

- Create several embeddings with:
    - Length:       50, 100, 500, 1000 
    - Algorithms:   Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, GLOve, etc.
    - Datasets:     TJ's, TJ's and add docs.
    - 

- Apply to machine learning algorithms like:
    - LSTM
    - CNN
    - RNN
